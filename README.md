# ElasticSIEM
In this guide, I set up a home lab using Elastic SIEM and a Parrot Security OS Laptop. I forwarded data from the Parrot OS device to SIEM using Elastic Beats agent, generated security events on the Parrot OS laptop and also pulled log data from the router, and analyzed the logs in the SIEM using the Elastic web interface.
